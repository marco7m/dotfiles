Linux users instructions.

To use the dotfiles, just run:

```bash
sh install.sh
```
This will update the .bashrc file and create symlinks to the dotfiles on your HOME.

If you get tired of using these dotfiles, just run:

```bash
sh uninstall.sh
```

This will remove all symlinks created by install.sh on your HOME.
